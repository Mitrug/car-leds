# car-leds

The aim of this project is to connect a Raspberry PI 3B+ and 4 WS2812B 60 LED strips to a car.

The colours of the LED strips are to be controlled by a mobile app. From the mobile app, one would be able to switch between pre-configured static and animated profiles available on the Raspberry PI.
